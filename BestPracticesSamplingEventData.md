## What is sampling-event data?

Sampling-event data is a type of data available from thousands of environmental, ecological, and natural resource investigations. These can be one-off studies or monitoring programmes. Such data are usually quantitative, calibrated, and follow certain protocols so that changes and trends of populations can be detected. This is in contrast to opportunistic observation and collection data, which today form a significant proportion of openly accessible biodiversity data. 

From the ecological perspective, sampling event data is qualitative presence-only or presence-absence data, or quantitative abundance data collected together with documented methodology, such as sampling technique, temporal, taxonomic, and spatial “envelope”, encompassing the reported observations.

To better understand the difference in data richness level, supported by GBIF [“onion” visualization based on Donald’s slides] one may think of checklist as of WHAT data, with name as the central element, of occurrence as of WHAT-WHERE-WHENs, individual observations, backed by the specimens or not. Sampling event data is different in richness and in packaging biodiversity data: events are WHERE-WHENs and occurrences WHAT-HOW-MUCH are listed for each of the event in a single table with optional quantitative data. Arguably the most important element of a dataset is metadata, containing WHO and HOW details.
