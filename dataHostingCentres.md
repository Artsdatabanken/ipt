#Data Hosting Centres

## Introduction

You can use a data hosting centre (DHC) IPT in your country to host and publish your dataset through [GBIF.org](http://www.gbif.org). 

Using a DHC is highly recommended because:

- It will save you time and money setting up your own IPT instance
- You can receive helpdesk support in your own language 

Here you will find a list of DHCs organised by country. Please note that a DHC is only included in this list if it meets the following strict requirements:  

- Their IPT is online near 100% of the time
- They can properly administer their IPT: 
  - Keeping it up-to-date with latest version having security updates, bug fixes, and new features
  - Managing user accounts
  - Managing IPT cores and extensions
- They can provide publishers with prompt helpdesk support:
  - Transferring knowledge about how to use the IPT to publish data through GBIF.org
  - Transferring knowledge about biodiversity data standards in general
  - Transferring knowledge about how to publish data papers
