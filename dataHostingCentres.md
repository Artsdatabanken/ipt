# Data Hosting Centres

## Introduction

A data hosting centre (DHC) can provide you with an account on their IPT, allowing you to manage your own datasets, and publish them through [GBIF.org](http://www.gbif.org).

Using a DHC is highly recommended because it will save you time and money setting up your own IPT instance, and you can receive helpdesk support in your own language. 

Please use this page to discover a trusted DHC in your own country. If no DHC exists in your country, or the DHC doesn't reply promptly to your inquiry, please contact the [GBIF Helpdesk](helpdesk@gbif.org) for assistance.  

Please note that to qualify as a trusted DHC, the centre must meet a strict set of [criteria](dataHostingCentres#data-hosting-centre-criteria). Like so, you can trust the DHC will keep their IPT online near 100% of the time, and they will ensure that your dataset gets backed-up. 

## Data Hosting Centre Criteria

A DHC must meet the following set of strict requirements in order to be recommended to publishers:  

- Their IPT is online near 100% of the time
- They can properly administer their IPT: 
  - Keeping it up-to-date with latest version
  - Ensuring the IPT data directory gets regularly backed-up
  - Managing user accounts
  - Managing IPT cores and extensions
- They have a proven track-record of hosting data for publishers in their country
- They can provide prompt and knowledgeable helpdesk support:
  - They know how to use the IPT to publish data through GBIF.org
  - They know about biodiversity data standards in general
  - They know how to publish data papers

If you believe your DHC meets these standards, and would like to offer your services to publishers in your country, please email <helpdesk@gbif.org>.
