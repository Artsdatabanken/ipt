## Introduction

Documenting the provenance and scope of datasets is required in order to publish data through the GBIF network. Dataset documentation is referred to as ‘resource metadata’ that enable users to evaluate the fitness-for-use of a dataset.

There are various ways to write a metadata document conforming to the GBIF Metadata Profile (GMP). This How-To Guide will go through the most common ways, such as using the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) metadata editor, the GBIF Resource Metadata template (pending), or generating a metadata document manually. The guide also serves as a reference guide to the GBIF Metadata Profile itself.

If metadata describing a dataset are also being published using Darwin Core Archives (DwC-A), the metadata file will be included in the DwC-A file that bundles it together with the data (based on the Darwin Core terms) that it describes. For help with making the complete DwC-A, refer to the [[Darwin Core Archive: How-To Guide|DwCAHowToGuide]].

Once the metadata document has been written and validated, it is ready to be published. 

Ultimately, the goal in publishing the metadata is that the data resource described therein can be fully documented and registered in the GBIF Registry. In so doing, the data resource becomes globally discoverable.

## Metadata Authoring: What to Use?

If sampling-event data, occurrence data or checklist data are being published using the IPT, there is a built-in metadata authoring functionality that can be used to write an accompanying metadata document conforming to the GMP. It may be convenient to use this tool for authoring metadata even if no data is being published, especially if there is a need to author and manage several metadata documents. On the other hand, if only a few metadata documents are needed, it might be easiest to generate them manually, for example by modifying a sample document. Below is a description of each of these methodologies.

### Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) 

The GBIF IPT is a free open-source tool for publishing biodiversity data, as well as resource metadata, that gets published as Darwin Core Archives (DwC-As). Users are recommended to reuse an [IPT data hosting centre](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/dataHostingCentres) instead of installing and maintaining their own installation.

The IPT contains a user-friendly interface that makes authoring metadata easy. Once a user has inputted and saved the minimum required metadata, they can return to it at any time to add to or modify the metadata.

In total, there are 12 different forms in the IPT that logically organise metadata entry. These are:

1.  Basic Metadata
2.  Geographic Coverage
3.  Taxonomic Coverage
4.  Temporal Coverage
5.  Other Keywords
6.  Associated Parties
7.  Project Data
8.  Sampling Methods
9.  Citations
10. Collection Data
11. Physical Data
12. Additional Metadata

The [[IPT User Manual|https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/IPT2ManualNotes.wiki#metadata]] goes through each form and its respective fields in some depth. The form provides help dialogs to aid the user in understanding what an element means (Figure 1).

_Figure 1. Screenshot of a help dialog for the term “Personnel Identifier”_

To ensure suitable data are entered, the fields are validated and informative messages displayed back to the user to assist them in filling out the forms (Figure 2).

_Figure 2. Screenshot of the field validation message displayed when an email field is submitted with an irregular email address._

For further reference, a description of each element in the GBIF Metadata Profile can be found below with an accompanying example.

The IPT publishes the metadata document and ensures that it is validated against the GBIF Metadata Profile so the user does not have to worry about validation.

If at any time the metadata are modified, the user only has to update the document and click the “Publish” button on the Manage Resource page to publish a new version of the document (resource) (Figure 3).

_Figure 3. Screenshot of the Published Versions section of the Manage Resource page of the IPT._

At any point, the resource manager can choose to make the resource publicly available on the Internet and subsequently even register it with GBIF making it globally discoverable. 

## GBIF Metadata Template

The GBIF Metadata Template will be similar to a manuscript template that makes it easy to submit resource metadata. The required fields will all be clearly indicated. Once data have been entered into the template, a metadata author will have to enter it into the IPT via the metadata editor. The IPT metadata editor ensures that fields that comply with controlled vocabularies get entered using the correct value, such as the country field. The IPT also ensures the generated metadata document is valid XML and validates against the GBIF Metadata Profile. Ultimately this two-step process (1. metadata template -> 2. IPT metadata editor) can be used to generate a valid resource metadata document. 

Where there is doubt about what a field means, refer to this guide to look up the description of its corresponding element with an accompanying example.

Modify an Existing Sample Document
----------------------------------

Another quick and easy way to author a metadata document conforming to the GMP is to take the [reference sample](http://tools.gbif.org/eml-gbif-sample.xml)[21] document and edit it. Refer to the following list to ensure it is completed properly:

1.  Fill in all required elements (Refer to the Appendix: Required Elements).

2.  Remove example placeholder information from all other fields that do not pertain to the data resource. Be careful to not remove fields (columns) as this could break the XML validity of the document. Nor should extra elements be added, unless it is to the “additionalMetadata” section.

3.  Set the “packageId” attribute inside the &lt;eml:eml&gt;. Remember, the packageId should be any globally unique ID fixed for that document. Whenever the document changes, it must be assigned a new packageId. For example: packageId='619a4b95-1a82-4006-be6a-7dbe3c9b33c5/eml-1.xml' for the 1<sup>st</sup> version of the document, packageId='619a4b95-1a82-4006-be6a-7dbe3c9b33c5/eml-2.xml' for the 2<sup>nd</sup> version, and so on.

To ensure that the new document is valid, both as an XML document and in conforming to the GMP, it is essential to validate the new document against the GML schema. To do so, use the online validation service provided by GBIF: <http://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/eml.do>. For help with debugging the XML document, please refer to the Appendix: Best practices guide to debugging/validating XML.

Required Elements
-----------------

It is recommended that as many elements are completed as possible to ensure that the metadata are as descriptive and complete as possible.

Nevertheless, the GMP has a minimum set of five mandatory elements. These mandatory elements are designed to allow a prospective end-user of the data to discover the resource’s name, description, contact person, and rights management information.

These elements are:

1.  Title

2.  MetadataProvider, creator, and contact with as much of the following as possible:

    1.  GivenName – part of individualName (Required)

    2.  Surname – part of individualName (Required)

    3.  OrganizationName

    4.  PositionName

    5.  Role

    6.  DeliveryPoint – part of address

    7.  City – part of address

    8.  AdministrativeArea – part of address

    9.  PostalCode – part of address

    10. Country – part of address

    11. Phone

    12. ElectronicMailAddress (Required)

    13. OnlineUrl

3.  Abstract

4.  PubDate

5.  Language (of metadata document)

For each element’s detailed description, you can refer to the [GBIF Metadata Profile Reference Guide](http://links.gbif.org/gbif_metadata_profile_guide_en_v1)[22]

-   Q: ***I receive the following error: “Eml validation error org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The processing instruction target matching "\[xX\]\[mM\]\[lL\]" is not allowed.” – what does this mean?***

-   A: Ensure there is no whitespace before &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;

-   Q: ***I receive something similar to the following error: “org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: An invalid XML character (Unicode: 0x1c) was found in the element content of the document – what does it mean?***

-   A: XML has a special set of characters that cannot be used in XML strings. These need to be replaced with their escaped equivalent:

1.  & should be replaced by &amp;

2.  &lt; should be replaced by &lt;

3.  &gt; should be replaced by &gt;

4.  " should be replaced by &quot;

5.  ' should be replaced by &\#39;

About GBIF
==========

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) was established as a global mega-science initiative to address one of the great challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century – harnessing knowledge of the Earth’s biological diversity. GBIF envisions ‘a world in which biodiversity information is freely and universally available for science, society, and a sustainable future’. GBIF’s mission is to be the foremost global resource for biodiversity information, and engender smart solutions for environmental and human well-being[1]. To achieve this mission, GBIF encourages a wide variety of data publishers across the globe to discover and publish data through its network.

Introduction
============

Metadata, literally “data about data” are an essential component of a data management system, describing such aspects as the “who, what, where, when and how” pertaining to a resource. In the GBIF context, resources are datasets, loosely defined as collections of related data, the granularity of which is determined by the data custodian. Metadata can occur in several levels of completeness. In general, metadata should allow a prospective end user of data to:

1.  Identify/discover its existence,

2.  Learn how to access or acquire the data,

3.  Understand its fitness-for-use, and

4.  Learn how to transfer (obtain a copy of) the data.

The GBIF Metadata Profile (GMP) was developed in order to standardise how resources get described at the dataset level in the GBIF [Data Portal](http://data.gbif.org)[2]. This profile can be transformed to other common metadata formats such as the ISO 19139 metadata profile[3].

In the GMP there is a minimum set of mandatory elements required for identification, but it is recommended that as many elements be used as possible to ensure the metadata are as descriptive and complete as possible.

There are various ways that you can write a metadata document conforming to the GMP, such as using the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) metadata editor, the GBIF Darwin Core Spreadsheet template metadata form, or simply taking a [sample metadata document](http://tools.gbif.org/eml-gbif-sample.xml) and replacing fields of relevance with your own data. For a thorough set of instructions on ways to author metadata conforming to the GMP, you can refer to the [GBIF Metadata Profile - How-To Guide.](http://links.gbif.org/gbif_metadata_profile_how-to_en_v1)[4]

Once the metadata document has been written, it can be validated against the [GBIF metadata profile schema](http://rs.gbif.org/schema/eml-gbif-profile/1.0/eml-gbif-profile.xsd)[5].

Metadata Elements
=================

<span id="_Toc254414783" class="anchor"></span>The GBIF Metadata Profile is primarily based on the Ecological Metadata Language (EML)[6]. The GBIF profile utilises a subset of EML and extends it to include additional requirements that are not accommodated in the EML specification. The following tables provide short descriptions of the profile elements, and where relevant, links to more complete EML descriptions. The elements are categorised as follows:

-   Dataset (Resource)

-   Project

-   People and Organisations

-   Keyword Set (General Keywords)

-   Coverage

| positionName          | This field is intended to be used instead of a particular person or full organization name. If the associated person that holds the role changes frequently, then Position Name would be used for consistency. Note that this field, used in conjunction with 'organizationName' and 'individualName' make up a single logical originator. Because of this, an originator with only the individualName of 'Joe Smith' is NOT the same as an originator with the name of 'Joe Smith' and the organizationName of 'NSF'. Also, the positionName should not be used in conjunction with individualName unless only that individual at that position would be considered an originator for the data package. If a positionName is used in conjunction with an organizationName, then that implies that any person who currently occupies said positionName at organizationName is the originator of the data package.

  The calendar date field is used to express a date, giving the year, month, and day. The format should be one that complies with the International Standards Organization's standard 8601. The recommended format for EML is YYYY-MM-DD, where Y is the four digit year, M is the two digit month code (01 - 12, where January = 01), and D is the two digit day of the month (01 - 31). This field can also be used to enter just the year portion of a date.

  The coverage field allows for a textual description of the specific sampling area, the sampling frequency (temporal boundaries, frequency of occurrence), and groups of living organisms sampled (taxonomic coverage). The field studyExtent represents both a specific sampling area and the sampling frequency (temporal boundaries, frequency of occurrence). The geographic studyExtent is usually a surrogate (representative area of) for the larger area documented in the "studyAreaDescription".

| jgtiCuratorialUnit         | A quantitative descriptor (number of specimens, samples or batches). The actual quantification could be covered by 1) an exact number of “JGI-units” in the collection plus a measure of uncertainty (+/- x); 2) a range of numbers (x to x), with the lower value representing an exact number, when the higher value is omitted. The discussion concluded that the quantification should encompass all specimens, not only those that have not yet been digitised. This is to avoid having to update the numbers too often. The number of non-public data (not digitised or not accessible) can be calculated from the GBIF numbers as opposed to the JGTI-data. |
