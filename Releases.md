The new templates provide a simpler solution for capturing, formatting and uploading three types of GBIF data classes: [sampling-event data](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/samplingEventData#templates "Link to sampling-event data template"), [occurrence data](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/occurrenceData#templates "Link to occurrence data template"), and [checklist data](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/checklistData#templates "Link to checklist data template"). More information about these templates can be found in [this news article](http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/new-darwin-core-spreadsheet-templates "News article about new GBIF templates").
