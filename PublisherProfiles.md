## What to do with your biodiversity data

### Introduction 

Are you an ecologist, researcher or institution with biodiversity data that is interested in unlocking its hidden potential while getting wider recognition?

If so, please consider making your data open access via [GBIF.org](http://www.gbif.org). This requires you to convert the data into a standardized format, however, doing so can unlock enormous hidden value in your data compared with simply depositing your data in a general-purpose repository such as Dryad or Figshare.

If you'd like to read more about the benefits of sharing your data through GBIF, you can continue reading here. Otherwise if you're already convinced that you'd like to share your data through GBIF and have (or have been granted) rights to publish the data, begin by identifying who you are and how much time and resources you can commit:

* An **individual** with plenty of time and interest in learning how to publish their own data
* An **individual** with limited time and who prefers someone else help publish their data for them
* An **organization** (or GBIF Node) with plenty of resources to commit to the long-term hosting and publishing of its own data
* An **organization** (or GBIF Node) with limited resources who prefers another organization help host and publish their data for them
