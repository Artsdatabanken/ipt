## What to do with your biodiversity data?

### Introduction 

Are you an ecologist, researcher or institution with biodiversity data that is interested in unlocking its hidden potential while getting wider recognition?

If so, please consider making your data open access via [GBIF.org](http://www.gbif.org). This requires you to convert the data into a standardized format, however, doing so can unlock enormous hidden value in your data compared with simply depositing your data in a general-purpose repository such as Dryad or Figshare.

If you'd like to read more about the benefits of sharing your data through GBIF, you can continue reading here. Otherwise if you're already convinced that you'd like to share your data through GBIF and have (or have been granted) rights to publish the data, start by choosing how to publish your data below.

### Choosing how to publish your data 

To start, identify who you are and how much time and resources you can commit to publishing your data. Based on your profile, the appropriate path to publishing your data is provided. 

* Are you an individual?

  * If you have plenty of time to learn how to publish your own data...
    
    _Great! Simply follow the instructions in this simple [how to publish guide](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/wiki/howToPublish)._

  * If you have limited time and require help publishing your data...

    _No problem! Simply fill in the [dataset catcher form](https://demo.gbif.org/tools/suggest-dataset) with a description of your dataset. This makes your dataset visible to hundreds of data publishers who can help publish your dataset for you. To speed up the process, be sure to include a link to where your raw data can be downloaded and to indicate why your dataset would be a valuable addition to the GBIF data-pool._ 

* Do you represent an organization, or GBIF Node?

  * If there are plenty of resources to commit to the long-term hosting and publishing of its own data...

    * If the organization has capacity to write its own publishing software...
    * If the organization has system administrators that can to install and maintain publishing software online...
  * If there are limited resources and the organization requires help to host and publish their data for them...
